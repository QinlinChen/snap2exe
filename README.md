# SNAP2EXE

`SNAP2EXE` aims to recover an ELF executable from a run-time snapshot of a process so that user can continue that process from where it was snapshoted by simply executing the recovered executable.

We provide a library and a binary tool:
- The library mainly contains an interface `checkpoint(cond)` by calling which a process can snapshot itself to an executable if `cond` is true.
- The binary tool `snap2exe` can attach to a process at run-time and snapshot it to an executable.

The executable generated by the library and the tool will continue to execute from where it was snapshoted.

## Build

Just use `make`, and the binary `snap2exe` will be output to the `./build` directory.

## Demo

```bash
$ gcc example.c -o example
$ ./example &
$ ./build/snap2exe $! save  # need sudo
$ ./save/<time>/cont        # need sudo
```

## Limits

- Can be only used on `x86_64-linux`.
- Cannot recover kernel states such as file descriptors.
